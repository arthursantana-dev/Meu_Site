    <p>I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down<br>
        I need your loving, loving<br>
        I need it now<br>
        When I'm without you, I'm something weak<br>
        You got me begging, begging<br>
        I'm on my knees<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna be needing your love<br>
        I just wanna be deep in your love<br>
        And it's killing me when you're away<br>
        Ooh, baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are<br>
        I just wanna be there where you are<br>
        And I gotta get one little taste<br>
        <br>
        Sugar, yes, please<br>
        Won't you come and put it down on me?<br>
        I'm right here, 'cause I need<br>
        Little love and little sympathy<br>
        Yeah, you show me good loving<br>
        Make it alright<br>
        Need a little sweetness in my life<br>
        Sugar, yes, please<br>
        Won't you come and put it down on me?<br>
        <br>
        My broken pieces, you pick them up<br>
        Don't leave me hanging, hanging<br>
        Come give me some<br>
        When I'm without ya, I'm so insecure<br>
        You are the one thing, one thing<br>
        I'm living for<br>
        
        I don't wanna be needing your love<br>
        I just wanna be deep in your love<br>
        And it's killing me when you're away<br>
        Ooh, baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are<br>
        I just wanna be there where you are<br>
        And I gotta get one little taste<br>
        <br>
        Sugar, yes, please<br>
        Won't you come and put it down on me?<br>

        <br>
        Yeah<br>
        I want that red velvet<br>
        I want that sugar sweet<br>
        Don't let nobody touch it<br>
        Unless that somebody's me<br>
        I gotta be a man<br>
        There ain't no other way<br>
        'Cause, girl, you're hotter than<br>
        The southern California bay<br>
        I don't wanna play no games<br>
        I don't gotta be afraid<br>
        Don't give all that shy shit<br>
        No make up on, that's my<br>
        
        Sugar, yes, please<br>
        Won't you come and put it down on me?<br>
        I'm right here, 'cause I need<br>
        Little love and little sympathy<br>
        Yeah, baby, you show me good loving<br>
